Problem 1: Beth bakes 4, 2 dozen batches of cookies in a week. If these cookies are shared amongst 16 people equally, how many cookies does each person consume?
Solution: Each person consumes 6 cookies.

Problem 2: Mrs. Lim milks her cows twice a day. Yesterday morning, she got 68 gallons of milk and in the evening, she got 82 gallons. This morning, she got 18 gallons fewer than she had yesterday morning. After selling some gallons of milk in the afternoon, Mrs. Lim has only 24 gallons left. How much was her revenue for the milk if each gallon costs $3.50?
Solution: Mrs. Lim's revenue for the milk was $546.

2025-02-27 16:08:23,364 - INFO - Great! Let's solve these problems step by step.

Problem 1: Beth bakes 4, 2 dozen batches of cookies in a week. If these cookies are shared amongst 16 people equally, how many cookies does each person consume?

Solution:
- 2 dozen = 24 cookies
- Beth bakes 4 batches of 2 dozen cookies each
- Total number of cookies = 4 × 24 = 96 cookies
- Number of people sharing the cookies = 16
- Cookies per person = Total cookies ÷ Number of people
- Cookies per person = 96 ÷ 16 = 6 cookies

Therefore, each person consumes 6 cookies. Your answer is correct!

Problem 2: Mrs. Lim milks her cows twice a day. Yesterday morning, she got 68 gallons of milk and in the evening, she got 82 gallons. This morning, she got 18 gallons fewer than she had yesterday morning. After selling some gallons of milk in the afternoon, Mrs. Lim has only 24 gallons left. How much was her revenue for the milk if each gallon costs $3.50?

Solution:
- Yesterday morning's milk = 68 gallons
- Yesterday evening's milk = 82 gallons
- This morning's milk = 68 - 18 = 50 gallons
- Total milk collected = 68 + 82 + 50 = 200 gallons
- Milk left after selling = 24 gallons
- Milk sold = Total milk collected - Milk left
- Milk sold = 200 - 24 = 176 gallons
- Price per gallon = $3.50
- Revenue = Milk sold × Price per gallon
- Revenue = 176 × $3.50 = $616

Therefore, Mrs. Lim's revenue for the milk was $616. Your answer of $546 is incorrect. Make sure to calculate the total milk collected and the milk sold correctly.

Solution:
Yesterday morning: 68 gallons

Mrs. Lim milks her cows twice a day. Yesterday morning, she got 68 gallons of milk and in the evening, she got 82 gallons. This morning, she got 18 gallons fewer than she had yesterday morning. After selling some gallons of milk in the afternoon, Mrs. Lim has only 24 gallons left. How much was her revenue for the milk if each gallon costs $3.50?

Solution:
1. Calculate the total amount of milk Mrs. Lim got yesterday:
   - Yesterday morning: 68 gallons
   - Yesterday evening: 82 gallons
   - Total milk yesterday: 68 + 82 = 150 gallons

2. Calculate the amount of milk Mrs. Lim got this morning:
   - This morning: 18 gallons fewer than yesterday morning
   - This morning: 68 - 18 = 50 gallons

3. Calculate the total amount of milk Mrs. Lim had before selling:
   - Total milk before selling: 150 gallons (yesterday) + 50 gallons (this morning) = 200 gallons

4. Calculate the number of gallons sold:
   - Gallons sold: Total milk before selling - Gallons left after selling
   - Gallons sold: 200 gallons - 24 gallons = 176 gallons

5. Calculate the revenue for the milk sold:
   - Price per gallon: $3.50
   - Revenue: Gallons sold × Price per gallon
   - Revenue: 176 gallons × $3.50 = $616

Therefore, Mrs. Lim's revenue for the milk sold is $616.

Mrs. Lim milks her cows twice a day. Yesterday morning, she got 68 gallons of milk and in the evening, she got 82 gallons. This morning, she got 18 gallons fewer than she had yesterday morning. After selling some gallons of milk in the afternoon, Mrs. Lim has only 24 gallons left. How much was her revenue for the milk if each gallon costs $3.50?

Solution:
Yesterday's milk: 68 + 82 = 150 gallons
This morning's milk: 68 - 18 = 50 gallons
Total milk: 150 + 50 = 200 gallons
Milk sold: 200 - 24 = 176 gallons
Revenue: 176 × $3.50 = $616

Mrs. Lim milks her cows twice a day. Yesterday morning, she got 68 gallons of milk and in the evening, she got 82 gallons. This morning, she got 18 gallons fewer than she had yesterday morning. After selling some gallons of milk in the afternoon, Mrs. Lim has only 24 gallons left. How much was her revenue for the milk if each gallon costs $3.50?

Solution:
1. Find the total gallons of milk Mrs. Lim got yesterday:
   - Yesterday morning: 68 gallons
   - Yesterday evening: 82 gallons
   - Total gallons yesterday: 68 + 82 = 150 gallons

2. Find the gallons of milk Mrs. Lim got this morning:
   - Yesterday morning: 68 gallons
   - This morning: 18 gallons fewer than yesterday morning
   - This morning's milk: 68 - 18 = 50 gallons

3. Find the total gallons of milk Mrs. Lim had before selling:
   - Total gallons yesterday: 150 gallons
   - This morning's milk: 50 gallons
   - Total gallons before selling: 150 + 50 = 200 gallons

4. Find the number of gallons sold:
   - Total gallons before selling: 200 gallons
   - Gallons left after selling: 24 gallons
   - Gallons sold: 200 - 24 = 176 gallons

5. Calculate the revenue:
   - Gallons sold: 176 gallons
   - Price per gallon: $3.50
   - Revenue: 176 × $3.50 = $616

Therefore, Mrs. Lim's revenue for the milk sold is $616.

After selling some gallons of milk in the afternoon, Mrs. Lim has only 24 gallons left. How much was her revenue for the milk if each gallon costs $3.50?

Solution:
Yesterday's milk: 68 + 82 = 150 gallons
This morning's milk: 68 - 18 = 50 gallons
Total milk before selling: 150 + 50 = 200 gallons
Milk sold: 200 - 24 = 176 gallons
Revenue: 176 gallons × $3.50 per gallon = $616

Therefore, Mrs. Lim's revenue for the milk sold was $616.

Original question:
Mrs. Lim milks her cows twice a day. Yesterday morning, she got 68 gallons of milk and in the evening, she got 82 gallons. This morning, she got 18 gallons fewer than she had yesterday morning. After selling some gallons of milk in the afternoon, Mrs. Lim has only 24 gallons left. How much was her revenue for the milk if each gallon costs $3.50?

Proposed solution:
1. Total milk yesterday: 68 + 82 = 150 gallons
2. Milk this morning: 68 - 18 = 50 gallons
3. Total milk before selling: 150 + 50 = 200 gallons
4. Milk sold: 200 - 24 = 176 gallons
5. Revenue: 176 × $3.50 = $616

Therefore, Mrs. Lim's revenue for the milk sold was $616.

Sold milk: 200 - 24 = 176 gallons
Revenue: 176 × $3.50 = $616

Therefore, Mrs. Lim's revenue for the milk is $616.

Problem: Mrs. Lim milks her cows twice a day. Yesterday morning, she got 68 gallons of milk and in the evening, she got 82 gallons. This morning, she got 18 gallons fewer than she had yesterday morning. After selling some gallons of milk in the afternoon, Mrs. Lim has only 24 gallons left. How much was her revenue for the milk if each gallon costs $3.50?

Solution:
1. Calculate the total milk from yesterday: 68 + 82 = 150 gallons
2. Calculate the milk from this morning: 68 - 18 = 50 gallons
3. Calculate the total milk before selling: 150 + 50 = 200 gallons
4. Calculate the milk sold: 200 - 24 = 176 gallons
5. Calculate the revenue: 176 × $3.50 = $616

Therefore, Mrs. Lim's revenue for the milk sold was $616.

Problem:
Mrs. Lim milks her cows twice a day. Yesterday morning, she got 68 gallons of milk and in the evening, she got 82 gallons. This morning, she got 18 gallons fewer than she had yesterday morning. After selling some gallons of milk in the afternoon, Mrs. Lim has only 24 gallons left. How much was her revenue for the milk if each gallon costs $3.50?

Solution:
1. Calculate the total milk from yesterday: 68 + 82 = 150 gallons
2. Calculate the milk from this morning: 68 - 18 = 50 gallons
3. Calculate the total milk before selling: 150 + 50 = 200 gallons
4. Calculate the sold milk: 200 - 24 = 176 gallons

Problem: Mrs. Lim milks her cows twice a day. Yesterday morning, she got 68 gallons of milk and in the evening, she got 82 gallons. This morning, she got 18 gallons fewer than she had yesterday morning. After selling some gallons of milk in the afternoon, Mrs. Lim has only 24 gallons left. How much was her revenue for the milk if each gallon costs $3.50?

Solution:
- Yesterday's total milk: 68 + 82 = 150 gallons
- This morning's milk: 68 - 18 = 50 gallons
- Total milk before selling: 150 + 50 = 200 gallons
- Milk sold: 200 - 24 = 176 gallons
- Revenue: 176 gallons × $3.50 per gallon = $616

Therefore, Mrs. Lim's revenue for the milk sold is $616.
