* Beth bakes 4 batches of cookies in a week.
* Each batch contains 2 dozen cookies.
* The cookies are shared equally among 16 people.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Find the total number of cookies Beth bakes in a week:
   * 1 batch = 2 dozen cookies
   * 4 batches = 4 ร 2 dozen cookies = 8 dozen cookies

2. Convert dozens to individual cookies:
   * 1 dozen = 12 cookies
   * 8 dozen cookies = 8 ร 12 cookies = 96 cookies

3. Divide the total number of cookies by the number of people:
   * Number of cookies each person gets = Total cookies รท Number of people
   * Number of cookies each person gets = 96 รท 16 = 6 cookies

Therefore, if Beth bakes 4 batches of cookies (2 dozen each) in a week and shares them equally among 16 people, each person will get 6 cookies.

2. Divide the total number of cookies equally among 16 people:
   - Number of cookies each person gets = Total number of cookies รท Number of people
   - Number of cookies each person gets = 96 รท 16 = 6 cookies.

Therefore, if Beth bakes 4 batches of cookies with 2 dozen in each batch, and these cookies are shared equally among 16 people, each person will get 6 cookies.

- Beth bakes 4 batches of cookies in a week.
- Each batch contains 2 dozen cookies.
- The cookies are shared equally among 16 people.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of cookies Beth bakes in a week.
- Each batch has 2 dozen cookies, and 1 dozen equals 12 cookies.
- Each batch has 2 ร 12 = 24 cookies.
- Total number of cookies = 4 batches ร 24 cookies per batch = 96 cookies.

Step 2: Determine the number of cookies each person gets.
- Number of cookies each person gets = Total number of cookies รท Number of people
- Number of cookies each person gets = 96 รท 16 = 6 cookies.

Therefore, each person will get 6 cookies when Beth's 4 batches of cookies, with 2 dozen in each batch, are shared equally among 16 people.

2025-02-26 18:20:54,032 - INFO - Alright, let's organize the given information:
- Beth bakes 4 batches of cookies in a week.
- Each batch contains 2 dozen cookies.
- The cookies are shared equally among 16 people.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Calculate the total number of cookies Beth bakes in a week:
   * 1 dozen = 12 cookies
   * 2 dozen = 2 ร 12 = 24 cookies per batch
   * 4 batches of 2 dozen each = 4 ร 24 = 96 cookies in total

2. Divide the total number of cookies by the number of people:
   * Total cookies = 96
   * Number of people = 16
   * Cookies per person = 96 รท 16 = 6

Therefore, if the cookies are shared equally among 16 people, each person will get 6 cookies.

* There are 6 people at the party (including Tina).
* 3 people (half of 6) have 3 sodas each.
* 2 people have 4 sodas each.
* 1 person has 5 sodas.

Now, let's solve:
1. Find the total number of sodas Tina bought:
   * 3 12-packs = 3 ร 12 = 36 sodas

2. Calculate the number of sodas consumed by the people who had 3 each:
   * 3 people ร 3 sodas each = 9 sodas

3. Calculate the number of sodas consumed by the people who had 4 each:
   * 2 people ร 4 sodas each = 8 sodas

4. Calculate the number of sodas consumed by the person who had 5:
   * 1 person ร 5 sodas = 5 sodas

5. Find the total number of sodas consumed:
   * 9 sodas (3 each) + 8 sodas (4 each) + 5 sodas (1 person) = 22 sodas

6. Subtract the consumed sodas from the total bought to find the leftovers:
   * 36 sodas (total bought) - 22 sodas (consumed) = 14 sodas left over

Therefore, when the party is over, there are 14 sodas left.

- Beth bakes 4 batches of cookies in a week.
- Each batch contains 2 dozen cookies.
- The cookies are shared equally among 16 people.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Find the total number of cookies Beth bakes in a week:
   * 1 batch = 2 dozen cookies
   * 4 batches = 4 ร 2 dozen cookies = 8 dozen cookies

2. Convert dozens to individual cookies:
   * 1 dozen = 12 cookies
   * 8 dozen cookies = 8 ร 12 cookies = 96 cookies

3. Divide the total number of cookies equally among 16 people:
   * Number of cookies each person gets = Total cookies รท Number of people
   * Number of cookies each person gets = 96 รท 16 = 6

Therefore, if Beth bakes 4 batches of cookies (with 2 dozen cookies in each batch) in a week and shares them equally among 16 people, each person will get 6 cookies.

* Beth bakes 4 batches of cookies in a week.
* Each batch contains 2 dozen cookies.
* The cookies are shared equally among 16 people.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Find the total number of cookies Beth bakes in a week:
   * 1 dozen = 12 cookies
   * 2 dozen = 12 ร 2 = 24 cookies in each batch
   * Number of cookies in 4 batches = 24 ร 4 = 96 cookies

2. Divide the total number of cookies by the number of people:
   * Number of people = 16
   * Cookies per person = Total cookies รท Number of people
   * Cookies per person = 96 รท 16 = 6

Therefore, each person consumes 6 cookies.

Given:
- Beth bakes 4 batches of cookies in a week.
- Each batch contains 2 dozen cookies.
- The cookies are shared equally among 16 people.

Step 1: Find the total number of cookies Beth bakes in a week
- 1 dozen = 12 cookies
- 2 dozen = 12 ร 2 = 24 cookies in each batch
- Number of cookies in 4 batches = 24 ร 4 = 96 cookies

Step 2: Divide the total number of cookies by the number of people
- Number of people = 16
- Cookies per person = Total cookies รท Number of people
- Cookies per person = 96 รท 16 = 6

Your conclusion is correct: each person consumes 6 cookies.

2025-02-26 18:35:08,680 - INFO - Okay, let's organize the information we have:
* Mrs. Lim milks her cows twice a day.
* Yesterday morning, she got 68 gallons, and in the evening, she got 82 gallons.
* This morning, she got 18 gallons fewer than yesterday morning.
* After selling some milk in the afternoon, she has 24 gallons left.
* Each gallon of milk costs $3.50.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Calculate the total milk Mrs. Lim got yesterday:
   * Yesterday's total milk = Morning milk + Evening milk
   * Yesterday's total milk = 68 gallons + 82 gallons = 150 gallons

2. Calculate the milk Mrs. Lim got this morning:
   * This morning's milk = Yesterday morning's milk - 18 gallons
   * This morning's milk = 68 gallons - 18 gallons = 50 gallons

3. Calculate the total milk Mrs. Lim had before selling:
   * Total milk before selling = Yesterday's total milk + This morning's milk
   * Total milk before selling = 150 gallons + 50 gallons = 200 gallons

4. Calculate the milk Mrs. Lim sold:
   * Milk sold = Total milk before selling - Remaining milk
   * Milk sold = 200 gallons - 24 gallons = 176 gallons

5. Calculate Mrs. Lim's revenue:
   * Revenue = Milk sold ร Price per gallon
   * Revenue = 176 gallons ร $3.50 = $616

Therefore, Mrs. Lim's revenue for the milk sold is $616.
